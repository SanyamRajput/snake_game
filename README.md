# 2D Snake Game (using Turtle)

This is a classic 2D Snake Game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library.

## How to Play

1. Installation Requirements:
   - Python 3.x (preferably Python 3.6 or above)
   - No additional libraries are required as Turtle comes pre-installed with Python.

2. Running the Game:
   - Clone this repository or download the source code.
   - Navigate to the directory where `thegame.py` is located.
   - Run `python thegame.py` in your terminal or command prompt.

3. Game Controls:
   - Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's direction.
   - The snake will move continuously in the direction it is heading.
   - Your goal is to eat the food (represented as a green dot) that appears randomly on the screen.
   - Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer.
   - The game ends if the snake runs into the walls or itself.

4. Scoring:
   - The score increases by 1 each time the snake eats food.

5. Game Over:
   - When the game ends, a message will display your final score.
   - Press any key to restart the game.

6. Customization:
   - You can modify game settings such as the speed of the snake or the size of the game window by adjusting constants within `snake_game.py`.

7. Files Included:
   - `snake_game.py`: Main Python script for the game.
   - `snake.py`: Snake class definition.
   - `food.py`: Food class definition.
   - `scoreboard.py`: For monitering the score.
